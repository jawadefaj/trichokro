  "journey_title": "Our Journey",
  "journey_text": "We began in 2022 with a simple idea: the everyday three-wheeler could be lighter, safer, and cheaper to operate. Early prototypes taught us what mattered most to drivers — range, charging time, and comfort. In 2023 we piloted our first fleet, iterating on chassis weldments, suspension tuning, and the battery-controller pairing. By 2024, those lessons became a production-ready platform: angular composite panels for robustness, a smart dash for clarity, and serviceable modules for roadside uptime. Today, TriChokro vehicles carry passengers across cities while we continue refining every kilometer of the experience.",
